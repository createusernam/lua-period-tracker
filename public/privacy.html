  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <p>Lua is a menstrual cycle tracker that runs entirely in your browser. Your privacy is the foundation of the app's architecture.</p>

  <h2>What data is collected</h2>
  <p>Lua only stores the period dates you enter. The app does not collect names, emails, phone numbers, or any personal information. There are no analytics, no tracking, and no ads.</p>

  <h2>Where data is stored</h2>
  <p>All data is stored in your browser's IndexedDB — locally on your device. Data is never sent to a Lua server because Lua has no server.</p>

  <h2>Google Drive backup</h2>
  <p>If you connect Google Drive, your data is uploaded to your personal Google Drive account as a JSON file. Lua uses the <code>drive.file</code> scope — it can only see files created by the app. Data is stored unencrypted in your Drive. Lua has no access to your data on Google's servers. You can disconnect sync at any time.</p>

  <h2>Third parties</h2>
  <p>Lua does not share data with third parties. When using Google Drive, <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's privacy policy</a> applies to data stored in your account.</p>

  <h2>Your rights</h2>
  <p>You have full control over your data. Export, import, or delete all data at any time via Settings.</p>

  <h2>Medical disclaimer</h2>
  <p>Lua is not a medical device. Cycle predictions, fertility windows, and ovulation estimates are informational only — based on statistical averages of your past data. Do not use them for contraception or medical decisions without consulting a healthcare provider.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>Questions and feedback — via <a href="https://github.com/createusernam/lua-period-tracker/issues">Issues</a> in the project's GitHub repository.</p>
